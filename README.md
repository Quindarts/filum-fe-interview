Filum AI Test

1. Overview
   The project was created for the purpose of learning and testing knowledge.

Here is a test that Filum AI gave me to assess my knowledge for the Growth Engineer Intern position.

- Features
  Here are the key features of the project:

Automatically share the survey result link via Facebook.
The shared link displays corresponding thumbnails for each result.
Use and customize a chart library to display the results.

- Request
  Here are the requirements for the test:

Build a tool that helps businesses understand their maturity in listening to customers.
Before starting, ask customers to provide their email address.
Customers will be asked to answer some questions.
After completing the assessment, customers will receive their maturity level and a description of it.
Customers can share their results through Facebook using the result link.
Sure, please provide the link so I can check if it's still active.

- Experiences
  Knowledge gained from the project:

Understanding how meta tags work.
Gaining more knowledge about Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs. Server-Side Rendering (SSR). 2. Important Notes:
Since the project is developed on the Windows operating system, it will perform best on Windows or Android. There may be some issues on iOS, macOS, and Linux.

When using the Facebook share button, please ensure that your browser is logged into Facebook. If Facebook in the browser is not logged in, it will display an error message like: "Invalid App ID: The provided app ID does not look like a valid app ID." Please log in and try again.
